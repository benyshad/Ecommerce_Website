The Garlic Press lets you enjoy the flavor of fresh garlic without the hard work of mincing and without your hands smelling like garlic. You can press fresh cloves of garlic—even the really big ones—without peeling them first. The handy cleaning brush helps you remove all the minced bits, so you never have to touch them. You can also use it to mince ginger and horseradish, so you get fantastic flavor in every bite of your favorite recipes.
