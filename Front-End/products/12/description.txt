<ul>
    <li>FITMENT: Compatible with 2007-2018 Jeep Wrangler JK</li>
    <li>ADVANCE TECHNOLOGY: Vented gaps allow increased airflow into the engine bay thus pushing out heat in the engine bay and away from the engine</li>

    <li>PRE-PREP FINISH: Produced from the factory coated with a rust inhibitor E-coating and is ready for pre-paint prep</li>

    <li>APPEARANCE: Even though designed for efficiency, the aesthetics of the hood will give your JL or JT an aggressive new look over that plain factory hood.</li>
    <li>PREP WORK REQUIRED: These replacement hoods are molded to the specifications of the Wrangler JK, however, due to tolerances there may be a requirement for adjustments (including shaping and dent corrections) to make them fit properly prior to paint</li>
